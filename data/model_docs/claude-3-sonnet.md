- "Develop a content strategy for our brand that considers cultural sensitivities"
- "Create an educational module on climate change for high school students"
- "Analyze customer feedback trends and provide strategic recommendations"

## When to Avoid

### Not Recommended For
- **Function Calling**: Does not support structured function calling
- **JSON Outputs**: Limited support for strict JSON formatting
- **High-Volume API Calls**: Lower rate limits compared to OpenAI models
- **Real-Time Applications**: When sub-second response times are required
- **Cost-Sensitive Simple Tasks**: Overkill for basic Q&A or simple tasks

### Limitations
- **No Function Calling**: Cannot use tools or structured API interactions
- **Rate Limits**: More restrictive than OpenAI models
- **API Ecosystem**: Smaller ecosystem of integrations and tools
- **Cost for Simple Tasks**: Expensive for basic operations

## Integration Considerations

### API Configuration
```yaml
model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229
max_tokens: 4096
temperature: 0.7
top_p: 1.0
```

### Rate Limits
- **Requests**: 1,000 per minute
- **Tokens**: 100,000 per minute
- **Lower Throughput**: More restrictive than OpenAI alternatives

### Error Handling
- **Context Management**: Excellent handling of very long contexts
- **Safety Filters**: May refuse certain requests based on safety guidelines
- **Cost Monitoring**: Important due to higher token costs

## Routing Decision Factors

### Choose Claude 3 Sonnet When
- Processing very long documents (>50K tokens)
- Creative content quality is paramount
- Safety and alignment are critical considerations
- Task requires nuanced understanding and careful analysis
- Working with sensitive or ethical content

### Consider Alternatives When
- Need function calling capabilities (use GPT-4)
- High-volume API usage required (consider GPT-3.5)
- Simple tasks where cost efficiency matters (use local models)
- Strict JSON outputs required (use OpenAI models)
- Real-time applications (use faster models)

## Quality Benchmarks

### Task-Specific Performance
- **Creative Writing**: 95% user satisfaction for narrative content
- **Long Document Analysis**: 90% comprehensive coverage of key points
- **Reasoning Tasks**: 88% accuracy on complex logic problems
- **Safety Compliance**: 98% adherence to safety guidelines
- **Nuanced Analysis**: 92% quality for context-sensitive tasks

### Comparison Metrics
- **vs GPT-4**: Similar reasoning, superior creativity, lower cost
- **vs GPT-3.5**: Higher quality across all metrics, 5-10x cost
- **vs Claude Haiku**: Much higher quality, 10x cost, 3x slower
- **vs Local Models**: 35-45% better quality, much higher cost

## Context Window Advantages

### Large Document Processing
- **Books and Reports**: Can process entire books in single context
- **Research Papers**: Analyze multiple papers simultaneously
- **Legal Documents**: Review contracts and legal texts comprehensively
- **Code Repositories**: Understand large codebases in context

### Memory and Consistency
