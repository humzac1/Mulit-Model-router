- "Create a detailed marketing strategy for a B2B SaaS product"

## When to Avoid

### Not Recommended For
- **Simple Q&A**: Basic factual questions that don't require complex reasoning
- **High-Volume Requests**: Scenarios requiring hundreds of API calls per minute
- **Cost-Sensitive Applications**: When budget constraints are primary concern
- **Real-Time Applications**: When sub-second response times are critical

### Limitations
- **Cost**: Expensive for simple tasks
- **Latency**: Slower than specialized models for basic tasks
- **Overkill**: Using GPT-4 for simple tasks is inefficient

## Integration Considerations

### API Configuration
```yaml
model: gpt-4-1106-preview
temperature: 0.7
max_tokens: 4096
top_p: 1.0
frequency_penalty: 0
presence_penalty: 0
```

### Rate Limits
- **Requests**: 500 per minute
- **Tokens**: 150,000 per minute
- **Daily Limits**: Varies by tier

### Error Handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff
- **Context Length**: Monitor token usage, implement chunking for large inputs
- **Cost Control**: Set spending limits and monitoring

## Routing Decision Factors

### Choose GPT-4 Turbo When
- Task requires complex multi-step reasoning
- High-quality creative output is needed
- Large context understanding is required
- User is willing to pay premium for quality
- Time constraints allow for 2-3 second responses

### Consider Alternatives When
- Simple factual questions (use GPT-3.5 or local models)
- Budget is primary constraint (use Claude Haiku or local models)
- Speed is critical (use faster models)
- Code-specific tasks (consider specialized code models)

## Quality Benchmarks

### Task-Specific Performance
