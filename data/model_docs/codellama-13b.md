## Best Use Cases

### Ideal Applications
1. **Code Generation**: Writing functions, classes, and complete programs
2. **Code Review**: Analyzing code for bugs, improvements, and best practices
3. **Documentation**: Generating code documentation and comments
4. **Code Explanation**: Explaining complex algorithms and code logic
5. **Debugging**: Identifying issues in existing code
6. **Code Translation**: Converting code between programming languages
7. **API Integration**: Generating code for API integrations and SDKs

### Example Scenarios
- "Write a Python function to parse JSON and validate email addresses"
- "Review this JavaScript code and suggest performance improvements"
- "Generate unit tests for this existing Python class"
- "Explain how this sorting algorithm works step by step"
- "Convert this Python code to JavaScript"
- "Write SQL queries for this database schema"

## When to Avoid

### Not Recommended For
- **Non-Programming Tasks**: General conversation, creative writing, analysis
- **Latest Frameworks**: Very new frameworks or libraries (knowledge cutoff)
- **Complex Architecture**: Large-scale system architecture decisions
- **Security Auditing**: Critical security analysis requiring expertise
- **Production-Critical Code**: Code that requires guaranteed correctness

### Limitations
- **Domain Focus**: Primarily useful for programming tasks only
- **Knowledge Cutoff**: May not know about very recent programming trends
- **Context Window**: Limited for very large codebases
- **Error Checking**: May generate syntactically correct but logically flawed code
- **Testing**: Generated code should always be tested thoroughly

## Integration Considerations

### Local Deployment
```yaml
# Ollama configuration
model: codellama:13b
host: localhost:11434
timeout: 60
temperature: 0.1  # Lower temperature for code generation
num_predict: 4096
```

### Hardware Requirements
- **Minimum**: 12GB RAM, modern multi-core CPU
- **Recommended**: 24GB+ RAM, GPU with 12GB+ VRAM for optimal performance
- **Storage**: 7-8GB for model weights

### Error Handling
- **Service Availability**: Monitor Ollama service health
- **Resource Management**: Handle memory constraints for large model
- **Code Validation**: Always validate and test generated code

## Routing Decision Factors

### Choose CodeLlama 13B When
- Task is clearly programming-related
- Cost efficiency is important for code generation
- Privacy of code is required (no external API calls)
- Working with common programming languages
- Need code explanations or documentation

### Consider Alternatives When
- Non-programming tasks (use general-purpose models)
- Latest framework knowledge required (use GPT-4 or Claude)
- Critical production code (use commercial models with higher reliability)
- Complex system architecture decisions (use GPT-4)
