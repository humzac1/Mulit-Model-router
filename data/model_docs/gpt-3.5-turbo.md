- "Answer customer questions about our return policy"
- "Translate this marketing copy from English to Spanish"
- "Write a simple Python script to process CSV files"

## When to Avoid

### Not Recommended For
- **Complex Reasoning**: Multi-step logical reasoning or advanced mathematics
- **Expert-Level Analysis**: Deep technical analysis requiring specialized knowledge
- **Creative Writing**: High-quality creative content like novels or screenplays
- **Large Document Processing**: Documents exceeding 16K token limit
- **Cutting-Edge Information**: Tasks requiring knowledge after September 2021

### Limitations
- **Context Window**: Limited to 16K tokens vs 128K in GPT-4
- **Reasoning Depth**: Less capable at complex logical reasoning
- **Creativity**: Lower quality creative outputs compared to GPT-4
- **Knowledge Currency**: Training data cutoff in September 2021

## Integration Considerations

### API Configuration
```yaml
model: gpt-3.5-turbo
temperature: 0.7
max_tokens: 2048
top_p: 1.0
frequency_penalty: 0
presence_penalty: 0
```

### Rate Limits
- **Requests**: 3,500 per minute
- **Tokens**: 250,000 per minute
- **High Throughput**: Suitable for high-volume applications

### Error Handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Generally less restrictive than GPT-4
- **Context Management**: Monitor 16K token limit
- **Cost Monitoring**: Still important for high-volume usage

## Routing Decision Factors

### Choose GPT-3.5 Turbo When
- Task is conversational or Q&A focused
- Cost efficiency is important
- Response speed is a priority
- Content fits within 16K token limit
- Task doesn't require cutting-edge reasoning

### Consider Alternatives When
- Complex reasoning or analysis required (upgrade to GPT-4)
- Highest quality creative content needed (use GPT-4 or Claude)
- Very simple tasks that could use local models (cost optimization)
- Specialized coding tasks (consider code-specific models)

## Quality Benchmarks

### Task-Specific Performance
- **Q&A Tasks**: 85% accuracy on factual questions
- **Summarization**: 82% comprehensiveness for documents under 10K tokens
- **Simple Coding**: 75% functional code on first attempt
- **Translation**: 80% accuracy for common language pairs
- **Conversation**: 88% natural dialogue quality

### Comparison Metrics
- **vs GPT-4**: 15-25% lower quality across most tasks, 10-20x lower cost
- **vs Claude Haiku**: Similar speed and cost, slightly better general performance
- **vs Local Models**: 20-30% better quality, higher cost but still affordable
- **vs Specialized Models**: Good general performance, may lack domain expertise

## High-Volume Considerations

### Scalability
- **Concurrent Requests**: Handles high concurrent load well
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient for processing multiple requests
- **Cost Management**: Predictable costs for large-scale applications

### Optimization Tips
- **Prompt Engineering**: Well-optimized prompts improve performance
- **Caching**: Cache responses for repeated queries
- **Streaming**: Use streaming for better user experience
- **Token Management**: Optimize prompts to reduce token usage
